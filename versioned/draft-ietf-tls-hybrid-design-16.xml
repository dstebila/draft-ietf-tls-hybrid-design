<t>Hybrid key exchange refers to using multiple key exchange algorithms simultaneously and combining the result with the goal of providing security even if a way is found to defeat the encryption for all but one of the component algorithms.  It is motivated by transition to post-quantum cryptography.  This document provides a construction for hybrid key exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>This document gives a construction for hybrid key exchange in TLS 1.3.  The overall design approach is a simple, "concatenation"-based approach: each hybrid key exchange combination should be viewed as a single new key exchange method, negotiated and transmitted using the existing TLS 1.3 mechanisms.</t>
      <t>This document does not propose specific post-quantum mechanisms; see <xref target="scope"/> for more on the scope of this document.</t>

<t>For the purposes of this document, it is helpful to be able to divide cryptographic algorithms into two classes:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>"Traditional" algorithms: Algorithms that are widely deployed today, but may be deprecated in the future.  In the context of TLS 1.3, examples of traditional key exchange algorithms include elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman using secp256r1 or x25519, or finite-field Diffie-Hellman.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>"Next-generation" (or "next-gen") algorithms: Algorithms that are not yet widely deployed, but may eventually be widely deployed.  An additional facet of these algorithms may be that the cryptographic community has less confidence in their security due to them being relatively new or less studied.  This includes "post-quantum" algorithms.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>"Hybrid" key exchange, in this context, means the use of two (or more) key exchange algorithms based on different cryptographic assumptions, e.g., one traditional algorithm and one next-gen algorithm, with the purpose of the final session key being secure as long as at least one of the component key exchange algorithms remains unbroken.
When one of the algorithms is traditional and one of them is post-quantum, this is a Post-Quantum Traditional Hybrid Scheme <xref target="PQUIP-TERM"/>; while this is the initial use case for this document, the document is not limited to this case.
This document uses the term "component" algorithms to refer to the algorithms combined in a hybrid key exchange.</t>
        <t>Some researchers prefer the phrase "composite" to refer to the use of multiple algorithms, to distinguish from "hybrid public key encryption" in which a key encapsulation mechanism and data encapsulation mechanism are combined to create public key encryption.</t>
        <t>It is intended that the component algorithms within a hybrid key exchange are to be performed, that is, negotiated and transmitted, within the TLS 1.3 handshake.  Any out-of-band method of exchanging keying material is considered out-of-scope.</t>
        <t>The primary motivation of this document is preparing for post-quantum algorithms.  However, it is possible that public key cryptography based on alternative mathematical constructions will be desired to mitigate risks independent of the advent of a quantum computer, for example because of a cryptanalytic breakthrough.  As such this document opts for the more generic term "next-generation" algorithms rather than exclusively "post-quantum" algorithms.</t>
        <t>Note that TLS 1.3 uses the phrase "groups" to refer to key exchange algorithms -- for example, the <tt>supported_groups</tt> extension -- since all key exchange algorithms in TLS 1.3 are Diffie-Hellman-based.  As a result, some parts of this document will refer to data structures or messages with the term "group" in them despite using a key exchange algorithm that is neither Diffie-Hellman-based nor a group.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="motivation">
        <name>Motivation for use of hybrid key exchange</name>
        <t>A hybrid key exchange algorithm allows early adopters eager for post-quantum security to have the potential of post-quantum security (possibly from a less-well-studied algorithm) while still retaining at least the security currently offered by traditional algorithms.  They may even need to retain traditional algorithms due to regulatory constraints, for example US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) FIPS compliance.</t>
        <t>Ideally, one would not use hybrid key exchange: one would have confidence in a single algorithm and parameterization that will stand the test of time.  However, this may not be the case in the face of quantum computers and cryptanalytic advances more generally.</t>
        <t>Many (though not all) post-quantum algorithms currently under consideration are relatively new; they have not been subject to the same depth of study as RSA and finite-field or elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman, and thus the security community does not necessarily have as much confidence in their fundamental security, or the concrete security level of specific parameterizations.</t>
        <t>Moreover, it is possible that after next-generation algorithms are defined, and for a period of time thereafter, conservative users may not have full confidence in some algorithms.</t>
        <t>Some users may want to accelerate adoption of post-quantum cryptography due to the threat of retroactive decryption (also known as harvest-now-decrypt-later): if a cryptographic assumption is broken due to the advent of a quantum computer or some other cryptanalytic breakthrough, confidentiality of information can be broken retroactively by any adversary who has passively recorded handshakes and encrypted communications.  Hybrid key exchange enables potential security against retroactive decryption while not fully abandoning traditional cryptosystems.</t>
        <t>As such, there may be users for whom hybrid key exchange is an appropriate step prior to an eventual transition to next-generation algorithms. Users should consider the confidence they have in each hybrid component to assess that the hybrid system meets the desired motivation.</t>

        <name>Scope</name>
        <t>This document focuses on hybrid ephemeral key exchange in TLS 1.3 <xref target="TLS13"/>.  It intentionally does not address:</t>

      <section anchor="goals">
        <name>Goals</name>
        <t>The primary goal of a hybrid key exchange mechanism is to facilitate the establishment of a shared secret which remains secure as long as one of the component key exchange mechanisms remains unbroken.</t>
        <t>In addition to the primary cryptographic goal, there may be several additional goals in the context of TLS 1.3:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t><strong>Backwards compatibility:</strong> Clients and servers who are "hybrid-aware", i.e., compliant with whatever hybrid key exchange standard is developed for TLS, should remain compatible with endpoints and middle-boxes that are not hybrid-aware.  The three scenarios to consider are:
            </t>
            <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
                <t>Hybrid-aware client, hybrid-aware server: These parties should establish a hybrid shared secret.</t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>Hybrid-aware client, non-hybrid-aware server:  These parties should establish a non-hybrid shared secret (assuming the hybrid-aware client is willing to downgrade to non-hybrid-only).</t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>Non-hybrid-aware client, hybrid-aware server:  These parties should establish a non-hybrid shared secret (assuming the hybrid-aware server is willing to downgrade to non-hybrid-only).</t>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <t>
Ideally backwards compatibility should be achieved without extra round trips and without sending duplicate information; see below.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t><strong>High performance:</strong> Use of hybrid key exchange should not be prohibitively expensive in terms of computational performance.  In general this will depend on the performance characteristics of the specific cryptographic algorithms used, and as such is outside the scope of this document.  See <xref target="PST"/> for preliminary results about performance characteristics.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t><strong>Low latency:</strong> Use of hybrid key exchange should not substantially increase the latency experienced to establish a connection.  Factors affecting this may include the following.
            </t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>
                <t>The computational performance characteristics of the specific algorithms used.  See above.</t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>The size of messages to be transmitted.  Public key and ciphertext sizes for post-quantum algorithms range from hundreds of bytes to over one hundred kilobytes, so this impact can be substantial.  See <xref target="PST"/> for preliminary results in a laboratory setting, and <xref target="LANGLEY"/> for preliminary results on more realistic networks.</t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>Additional round trips added to the protocol.  See below.</t>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t><strong>No extra round trips:</strong> Attempting to negotiate hybrid key exchange should not lead to extra round trips in any of the three hybrid-aware/non-hybrid-aware scenarios listed above.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t><strong>Minimal duplicate information:</strong> Attempting to negotiate hybrid key exchange should not mean having to send multiple public keys of the same type.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The tolerance for lower performance / increased latency due to use of hybrid key exchange will depend on the context and use case of the systems and the network involved.</t>

      <t>The main security property for KEMs is indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2), which means that shared secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings even given the ability to have other arbitrary ciphertexts decapsulated.  IND-CCA2 corresponds to security against an active attacker, and the public key / secret key pair can be treated as a long-term key or reused (see for example <xref target="KATZ"/> or <xref target="HHK"/> for definitions of IND-CCA2 and IND-CPA security).  A common design pattern for obtaining security under key reuse is to apply the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform <xref target="FO"/> or a variant thereof <xref target="HHK"/>.</t>
      <t>A weaker security notion is indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA), which means that the shared secret values should be indistinguishable from random strings given a copy of the public key.  IND-CPA roughly corresponds to security against a passive attacker, and sometimes corresponds to one-time key exchange.</t>
      <t>Key exchange in TLS 1.3 is phrased in terms of Diffie-Hellman key exchange in a group.  DH key exchange can be modeled as a KEM, with <tt>KeyGen</tt> corresponding to selecting an exponent <tt>x</tt> as the secret key and computing the public key <tt>g^x</tt>; encapsulation corresponding to selecting an exponent <tt>y</tt>, computing the ciphertext <tt>g^y</tt> and the shared secret <tt>g^(xy)</tt>, and decapsulation as computing the shared secret <tt>g^(xy)</tt>. See <xref target="HPKE"/> for more details of such Diffie-Hellman-based key encapsulation mechanisms. Diffie-Hellman key exchange, when viewed as a KEM, does not formally satisfy IND-CCA2 security, but is still safe to use for ephemeral key exchange in TLS 1.3, see for example <xref target="DOWLING"/>.</t>
      <t>TLS 1.3 does not require that ephemeral public keys be used only in a single key exchange session; some implementations may reuse them, at the cost of limited forward secrecy.  As a result, any KEM used in the manner described in this document <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> explicitly be designed to be secure in the event that the public key is reused.  Finite-field and elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange methods used in TLS 1.3 satisfy this criteria.  For generic KEMs, this means satisfying IND-CCA2 security or having a transform like the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform <xref target="FO"/> <xref target="HHK"/> applied.  While it is recommended that implementations avoid reuse of KEM public keys, implementations that do reuse KEM public keys <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure that the number of reuses of a KEM public key abides by any bounds in the specification of the KEM or subsequent security analyses.  Implementations <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> reuse randomness in the generation of KEM ciphertexts.</t>

      <section anchor="construction-transmitting">
        <name>Transmitting public keys and ciphertexts</name>
        <t>This document takes the relatively simple "concatenation approach": the messages from the two or more algorithms being hybridized will be concatenated together and transmitted as a single value, to avoid having to change existing data structures.  The values are directly concatenated, without any additional encoding or length fields; the representation and length of elements <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be fixed once the algorithm is fixed.</t>
        <t>Recall that in TLS 1.3 <xref target="TLS13"/> Section 4.2.8, a KEM public key or KEM ciphertext is represented as a <tt>KeyShareEntry</tt>:</t>
        <artwork><![CDATA[
    struct {
        NamedGroup group;
        opaque key_exchange<1..2^16-1>;
    } KeyShareEntry;

    } KeyShareClientHello;

    struct {
        KeyShareEntry server_share;
    } KeyShareServerHello;
]]></artwork>
        <t>The client's shares are listed in descending order of client preference; the server selects one algorithm and sends its corresponding share.</t>
        <t>For a hybrid key exchange, the <tt>key_exchange</tt> field of a <tt>KeyShareEntry</tt> is the concatenation of the <tt>key_exchange</tt> field for each of the constituent algorithms.  The order of shares in the concatenation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the same as the order of algorithms indicated in the definition of the <tt>NamedGroup</tt>.</t>
        <t>For the client's share, the <tt>key_exchange</tt> value contains the concatenation of the <tt>pk</tt> outputs of the corresponding KEMs' <tt>KeyGen</tt> algorithms, if that algorithm corresponds to a KEM; or the (EC)DH ephemeral key share, if that algorithm corresponds to an (EC)DH group.  For the server's share, the <tt>key_exchange</tt> value contains concatenation of the <tt>ct</tt> outputs of the corresponding KEMs' <tt>Encaps</tt> algorithms, if that algorithm corresponds to a KEM; or the (EC)DH ephemeral key share, if that algorithm corresponds to an (EC)DH group.</t>
        <t><xref target="TLS13"/> Section 4.2.8 requires that ``The key_exchange values for each KeyShareEntry <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be generated independently.''  In the context of this document, since the same algorithm may appear in multiple named groups, this document relaxes the above requirement to allow the same key_exchange value for the same algorithm to be reused in multiple KeyShareEntry records sent within the same <tt>ClientHello</tt>.  However, key_exchange values for different algorithms <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be generated independently. Explicitly, if the <tt>NamedGroup</tt> is the hybrid key exchange <tt>MyECDHMyPQKEM</tt>, the <tt>KeyShareEntry.key_exchange</tt> values <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be generated in one of the following two ways:</t>

        <t><strong>FIPS-compliance of shared secret concatenation.</strong>
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) documents <xref target="NIST-SP-800-56C"/> and <xref target="NIST-SP-800-135"/> give recommendations for key derivation methods in key exchange protocols.  Some hybrid combinations may combine the shared secret from a NIST-approved algorithm (e.g., ECDH using the nistp256/secp256r1 curve) with a shared secret from a non-approved algorithm (e.g., post-quantum).  <xref target="NIST-SP-800-56C"/> lists simple concatenation as an approved method for generation of a hybrid shared secret in which one of the constituent shared secret is from an approved method.</t>

      <t><strong>Larger public keys and/or ciphertexts.</strong>
The <tt>key_exchange</tt> field in the <tt>KeyShareEntry</tt> struct in <xref target="construction-transmitting"/> limits public keys and ciphertexts to 2^16-1 bytes.  Some post-quantum KEMs have larger public keys and/or ciphertexts; for example, Classic McEliece's smallest parameter set has public key size 261,120 bytes.  However, all defined parameter sets for ML-KEM <xref target="NIST-FIPS-203"/> have public keys and ciphertexts that fall within the TLS constraints (although may result in ClientHello messages larger than a single packet).</t>
      <t><strong>Duplication of key shares.</strong>
Concatenation of public keys in the <tt>key_exchange</tt> field in the <tt>KeyShareEntry</tt> struct as described in <xref target="construction-transmitting"/> can result in sending duplicate key shares.  For example, if a client wanted to offer support for two combinations, say "SecP256r1MLKEM768" and "X25519MLKEM768" <xref target="ECDHE-MLKEM"/>, it would end up sending two ML-KEM-768 public keys, since the <tt>KeyShareEntry</tt> for each combination contains its own copy of a ML-KEM-768 key.  This duplication may be more problematic for post-quantum algorithms which have larger public keys.  On the other hand, if the client wants to offer, for example "SecP256r1MLKEM768" and "secp256r1" (for backwards compatibility), there is relatively little duplicated data (as the secp256r1 keys are comparatively small).</t>
      <t><strong>Failures.</strong>
Some post-quantum key exchange algorithms, including ML-KEM <xref target="NIST-FIPS-203"/>, have non-zero probability of failure, meaning two honest parties may derive different shared secrets.  This would cause a handshake failure.  ML-KEM has a cryptographically small failure rate; if other algorithms are used, implementers should be aware of the potential of handshake failure. Clients <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> retry if a failure is encountered.</t>

      <t>IANA will assign identifiers from the TLS Supported Groups registry <xref target="IANATLS"/> for the hybrid combinations defined following this document.
These assignments should be made in a range that is distinct from the Finite Field Groups range.

    </section>
    <section anchor="security-considerations">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The shared secrets computed in the hybrid key exchange should be computed in a way that achieves the "hybrid" property: the resulting secret is secure as long as at least one of the component key exchange algorithms is unbroken.  See <xref target="GIACON"/> and <xref target="BINDEL"/> for an investigation of these issues.  Under the assumption that shared secrets are fixed length once the combination is fixed, the construction from <xref target="construction-shared-secret"/> corresponds to the dual-PRF combiner of <xref target="BINDEL"/> which is shown to preserve security under the assumption that the hash function is a dual-PRF.</t>
      <t>As noted in <xref target="kems"/>, KEMs used in the manner described in this document <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> explicitly be designed to be secure in the event that the public key is reused, such as achieving IND-CCA2 security or having a transform like the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform applied.  ML-KEM has such security properties.  However, some other post-quantum KEMs designed to be IND-CPA-secure (i.e., without countermeasures such as the FO transform) are completely insecure under public key reuse; for example, some lattice-based IND-CPA-secure KEMs are vulnerable to attacks that recover the private key after just a few thousand samples <xref target="FLUHRER"/>.</t>
      <t><strong>Public keys, ciphertexts, and secrets should be constant length.</strong>
This document assumes that the length of each public key, ciphertext, and shared secret is fixed once the algorithm is fixed.  This is the case for ML-KEM.</t>
      <t>Note that variable-length secrets are, generally speaking, dangerous.  In particular, when using key material of variable length and processing it using hash functions, a timing side channel may arise.  In broad terms, when the secret is longer, the hash function may need to process more blocks internally.  In some unfortunate circumstances, this has led to timing attacks, e.g., the Lucky Thirteen <xref target="LUCKY13"/> and Raccoon <xref target="RACCOON"/> attacks.</t>
      <t>Furthermore, <xref target="AVIRAM"/> identified a risk of using variable-length secrets when the hash function used in the key derivation function is no longer collision-resistant.</t>
      <t>If concatenation were to be used with values that are not fixed-length, a length prefix or other unambiguous encoding would need to be used to ensure that the composition of the two values is injective and requires a mechanism different from that specified in this document.</t>
      <t>Therefore, this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be used with algorithms which have fixed-length shared secrets (after the variant has been fixed by the algorithm identifier in the <tt>NamedGroup</tt> negotiation in <xref target="construction-negotiation"/>).</t>

The immediate impetus for this document came from discussions with attendees at the Workshop on Post-Quantum Software in Mountain View, California, in January 2019.  Daniel J.

            <abstract>
              <t>   Hybrid key exchange refers to executing two independent key exchanges
   and feeding the two resulting shared secrets into a Pseudo Random
   Function (PRF), with the goal of deriving a secret which is as secure
   as the stronger of the two key exchanges.  This document describes
   new hybrid key exchange schemes for the Transport Layer Security 1.2
   (TLS) protocol.  The key exchange schemes are based on combining
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) with a post-quantum key
   encapsulation method (PQ KEM) using the existing TLS PRF.

              <t>This document describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption (HPKE). This scheme provides a variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key. It also includes three authenticated variants, including one that authenticates possession of a pre-shared key and two optional ones that authenticate possession of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) private key. HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric KEM, key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function. Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs. We provide instantiations of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF), and SHA2.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>   This document describes how to extend Internet Key Exchange Protocol
   Version 2 (IKEv2) so that the shared secret exchanged between peers
   has resistance against quantum computer attacks.  The basic idea is
   to exchange one or more post-quantum key exchange payloads in

            <abstract>
              <t>The possibility of quantum computers poses a serious challenge to cryptographic algorithms deployed widely today. The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem that could be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could decrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer is available. It is anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-secure key exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen in the near term. To address this problem before then, this document describes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a quantum computer by using preshared keys.</t>

              <t>One aspect of the transition to post-quantum algorithms in cryptographic protocols is the development of hybrid schemes that incorporate both post-quantum and traditional asymmetric algorithms. This document defines terminology for such schemes. It is intended to be used as a reference and, hopefully, to ensure consistency and clarity across different protocols, standards, and organisations.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>This note describes the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), a hash-based digital signature system that is based on existing descriptions in scientific literature. This note specifies Winternitz One-Time Signature Plus (WOTS+), a one-time signature scheme; XMSS, a single-tree scheme; and XMSS^MT, a multi-tree variant of XMSS. Both XMSS and XMSS^MT use WOTS+ as a main building block. XMSS provides cryptographic digital signatures without relying on the conjectured hardness of mathematical problems. Instead, it is proven that it only relies on the properties of cryptographic hash functions. XMSS provides strong security guarantees and is even secure when the collision resistance of the underlying hash function is broken. It is suitable for compact implementations, is relatively simple to implement, and naturally resists side-channel attacks. Unlike most other signature systems, hash-based signatures can so far withstand known attacks using quantum computers.</t>

              <t>   This draft defines three hybrid key agreements for TLS 1.3:
   X25519MLKEM768, SecP256r1MLKEM768, and SecP384r1MLKEM1024 which
   combine a post-quantum KEM with an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDHE).

      <t>Quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography in general are outside the scope of this document.  For a general introduction to quantum computing, see a standard textbook such as <xref target="NIELSEN"/>.  For an overview of post-quantum cryptography as of 2009, see <xref target="BERNSTEIN"/>; while not containing more recent advances, it still provides a helpful introduction.  For the current status of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, see <xref target="NIST"/>.  For additional perspectives on the general transition from traditional to post-quantum cryptography, see for example <xref target="ETSI"/>, among others.</t>
      <t>There have been several Internet-Drafts describing mechanisms for embedding post-quantum and/or hybrid key exchange in TLS:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>Internet-Drafts for TLS 1.2: <xref target="WHYTE12"/>, <xref target="CAMPAGNA"/></t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Internet-Drafts for TLS 1.3: <xref target="KIEFER"/>, <xref target="SCHANCK"/>, <xref target="WHYTE13"/></t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>There have been several prototype implementations for post-quantum and/or hybrid key exchange in TLS:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>Experimental implementations in TLS 1.2: <xref target="BCNS15"/>, <xref target="CECPQ1"/>, <xref target="FRODO"/>, <xref target="OQS-102"/>, <xref target="S2N"/></t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Experimental implementations in TLS 1.3: <xref target="CECPQ2"/>, <xref target="OQS-111"/>, <xref target="OQS-PROV"/>, <xref target="PST"/></t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>These experimental implementations have taken an ad hoc approach and not attempted to implement one of the drafts listed above.</t>
      <t>Unrelated to post-quantum but still related to the issue of combining multiple types of keying material in TLS is the use of pre-shared keys, especially the recent TLS working group document on including an external pre-shared key <xref target="EXTERN-PSK"/>.</t>
      <t>Considering other IETF standards, there is work on post-quantum preshared keys in IKEv2 <xref target="IKE-PSK"/> and a framework for hybrid key exchange in IKEv2 <xref target="IKE-HYBRID"/>.  The XMSS hash-based signature scheme has been published as an informational RFC by the IRTF <xref target="XMSS"/>.</t>
      <t>In the academic literature, <xref target="EVEN"/> initiated the study of combining multiple symmetric encryption schemes; <xref target="ZHANG"/>, <xref target="DODIS"/>, and <xref target="HARNIK"/> examined combining multiple public key encryption schemes, and <xref target="HARNIK"/> coined the term "robust combiner" to refer to a compiler that constructs a hybrid scheme from individual schemes while preserving security properties.  <xref target="GIACON"/> and <xref target="BINDEL"/> examined combining multiple key encapsulation mechanisms.</t>
